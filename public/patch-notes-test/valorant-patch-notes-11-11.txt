VALORANT Patch Notes 11.11VALORANT Patch Notes 11.11Minor UI updates, Bug Fixes, VP gifting, and a festive surprise coming soon.Game UpdatesKenny “Karnifexlol“ Cameron2025-12-02T14:00:00.000ZHey, everyone! Kenny, here.
If this patch looks tiny to you, well, that’s because it is. Or is it…? There might just be a lil’ festive surprise around the corner that we’re not listing here quite yet. Hehe.
Other than that, we’ve got:
UI improvements to the Agents page
A way to gift VP to your friends. Just in time for the holidays.
More bug fixes.
And a small Ranked Gun Buddy issue for you to be aware of.
This will be the last patch of 2025! Riot will be on Holiday break when our next patch would normally come out, so we’ll see you all back here next year with…a few more surprises up our sleeve.
Until then, Happy New Year and GL HF GGs in 2026!ALL PLATFORMS

KNOWN ISSUES
V25A3 ranked gun buddies will temporarily be shown in your collection with the incorrect name of “V25A6.”
Don’t worry! Your buddy for the first three Acts of Season 2025 is safe.
It will go back to its correct name and you’ll also receive your V25A6 gun buddy (if you earned an Act rank in the last three Acts of Season 2025) in the 12.00 patch.
