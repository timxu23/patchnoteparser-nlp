             Hello everyone, this patch is a big one! The entire VALORANT team has been working to bring VALORANT closer to our long-term vision for the game, preserving our core identity as a tactical shooter while evolving toward a healthier balance between gunplay and abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
             TL;DR- we are making adjustments across gameplay to create a healthy dialogue in combat - one where there are clear ways to respond and adapt to what the enemy team is doing round over round. These changes aim to strike a healthier balance between sharp gunplay and the unique abilities that give VALORANT its signature tactical flavor. They span agents, weapons, and maps, all aimed at rewarding strategic decision-making in VALORANT.
            </p>
            <h2>
             ALL PLATFORMS

             GENERAL UPDATES
            </h3>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Our end of year balance patch is meant to adjust how our maps, weapons, and agents work together. The tuning pass in this patch is designed to reinforce what we call "the competitive dialogue"-the round-to-round exchange between attackers and defenders that rewards adaptation and strategy.
             </li>
             <li>
              Over time, as player skill and ability impact have grown, uncoordinated utility has at times felt just as impactful as well-executed, strategic plays. This has reduced meaningful opportunities for counterplay and diminished the strategic depth we aim for in VALORANT. These changes are focused on striking a healthy balance between gunplay and the abilities that make VALORANT its own unique flavor of tactical shooter.

            <ul>
             <li>
              The agent updates this patch are focused around how we can support higher mastery around ability usage. We want to allow your gunplay to do the talking, while you use abilities strategically and intentionally to gain advantages. These changes should reward players who use abilities well in the right time and place. Additionally, we're also reducing the size of some of the largest ultimate abilities.
             </li>
             <li>
              We're also aiming to create more consistency across the game's various debuffs, making it easier to build muscle memory when playing with or against effects like Nearsight, Concuss, and Stims.

              are intended to be the go-to agents for breaking angles and creating openings for their team.

These abilities should remain impactful, but now demand more coordination and deliberate timing to unlock their full value.

Trapwire has been adjusted to be less lethal, though Cypher can still convert to a kill when they are disrespected.

Each weapon in our arsenal should feel they have a unique identity with their own strengths and weaknesses and though the arsenal has felt like it's overall pretty healthy, we want to make sure we continue to push on making weapons feel like competitive choices for different scenarios and round economy states.

We want the decision between tapping, bursting, and spraying to feel more balanced and a more meaningful optimization. We are making some minor adjustments to spraying rifles to make them more of a viable option for fights at the close and mid ranges.

                <ul>
                 <li>
                  % chance of yaw switch: % chance the gun will swap horizontal recoil from one side to the other (left vs right from your crosshair)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Yaw switch time: how quickly the gun swaps horizontal recoil from one side to the other. When yaw switch time increases, this means you have more time to counteract the recoil
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Protected bullet counts: how many bullets in a spray you can use before your gun has a chance of yaw switch
