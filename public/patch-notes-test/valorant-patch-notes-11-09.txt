VALORANT Patch Notes 11.09VALORANT Patch Notes 11.09MFA added for shared accounts, quality of life updates, and bug fixes.Game UpdatesAshley Tsao2025-10-28T13:00:00.000ZHey folks, it's Ash! We've got a few important implementations to improve your gameplay experience, addressing smurfing and new QOL updates with interactive objects, so focus up!
TLDR;
MFA required for accounts we've flagged as shared accounts to play Competitive queue
Quality of life updates for interactive objects and abilities
Many map and Agent bug fixes
As always, we're regularly evaluating and improving our detection systems for botting and are happy to share that we've banned a significant number of accounts. Farewell botters, you will not be missed!
Separately, we've started penalizing some of the most egregious offenders of smurfing-purchased accounts that have been detected for boosting will be banned starting this patch.ALL PLATFORMS
COMPETITIVE UPDATES
Starting in 11.09, accounts detected for sharing in NA, LATAM, BR, and KR, must enable Riot Mobile multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access Competitive queue. Other modes will remain unaffected.
You can check out this article for more information on why we're making this change, or get yourself set up with MFA now using this how-to guide.
Reminder to please report players for smurfing as Rank Manipulation. Your reports will help us level up our detections!
And lastly, a quick reminder that all Ascendant+ players will be required to add Riot Mobile MFA to their accounts in the above regions in an upcoming patch.
GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS UPDATES
We're rolling out some small quality of life updates that should make it easier for you to perform the action you intend to in-game. Interactive objects are the focus of this patch, and this will cover everything your "Use Object" button will do-basically, anything where you press "F" on PC or Square/X on Console by default.
Interactive Object Highlighting - World interactions including Switches, Ropes, Ziplines and Ultimate Orbs have been updated to use the standard green highlight color that other interactive objects in the game use.
Interactive Object Prioritization - Aiming can now prioritize highlighted actions when multiple are possible. So now when you're in a Deadlock GravNet next to a Rope, you'll have more control over what you're interacting with first.
