we need to note down each version like so:
VALORANT Patch Notes (*\d.*\d)
so that the version number is actually a number that can go in order

GENERAL UPDATES
observed: mostly pure words, no numbers, so it's hard to track, usually no crutial information so we can ignore
AGENT UPDATES
observed: mostly pure words, no numbers, so it's hard to track, but there are crutial information so we need to think of a way to extract and track
COMPETITIVE UPDATES
mostly irrelevant, we can ignore this section
ESPORTS UPDATES
