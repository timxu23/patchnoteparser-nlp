We’ve overhauled Harbor’s abilities to move him into a more aggressive Controller, with a splash of Initiator. High Tide was an iconic part of his kit and we wanted players to be able to carry over their mastery and creativity from High Tide casts in the past. We’ve moved Cove into the signature slot with a few changes to make it easier to place with precision. This should help Harbor find more ways to block vision for his allies from afar or Shield them depending on the situation. Harbor will be gaining a new ability to help with aggressively taking gun fights, Storm Surge! Reckoning also received a massive update, making it easier to set up his allies to flood into enemy territory.Read the updated Ability Tooltips below, and check out our social channels for more content breaking down Harbor’s reworked abilities. We’re very excited for you to all dive in!CoveChanged to the signature ability slotEQUIP Cove. ACTIVATE to form a water Smoke in the select location. HOLD FIRE while targeting to move the marker further away and HOLD ALT FIRE to move it closer. RELOAD to toggle targeting view. REACTIVATE to Shield the water Smoke, blocking any bullets that hit it. The Shielded water Smoke can be destroyed.High TideChanged to a non-signature abilityCost 300 creditsStorm Surge (New)EQUIP Storm Surge. FIRE to throw, creating an explosive whirlpool that Nearsights and Slows enemies within it after a short duration.ReckoningEQUIP Reckoning. FIRE to unleash the full power of your artifact, releasing a surge of water that barrels forward to Nearsight and Slow enemies that are hit.We've also updated Harbor’s voice lines to reflect his updated abilities. We added conversation voice lines with Tejo and Waylay and have new lines at the start of the match on Abyss and Corrode.CloveClove is dominating competitive queue pick rates and preventing other controllers from being picked. These changes are aimed at shaving off Clove’s snowballing power. When Clove’s team gets ahead in advantageous states, they very easily outperform other controllers.RuseRuse charges are now restricted to 1 maximum when Clove is deadPick Me UpOverheal amount, while Pick Me Up is active, has been reduced from 100 HP → 50 HPOmenSpectators can now see Omen’s perspective in Dark Cover when he is placing his smokes.COMPETITIVE UPDATESStarting in 11.10, all Ascendant+ players in NA, LATAM, BR, and KR, must enable Riot Mobile multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access Competitive queue. Other modes will remain unaffected.
Why Ascendant+? Our highest ranked players are capable of inflicting the greatest harm when smurfing and are at risk of more competitive integrity violations as an outcome to sharing accounts – i.e. win trading.You can check out this article for more information on why we’re making this change, or get yourself set up with MFA now using this how-to guide.ESPORTS UPDATESWe’re bringing Pick’ Ems to GameChangers!Starting on November 13, the tournament will open in-client and on the web. Predict the full 10 team double elimination bracket winners for points and earn unique rewards for participating.GAMEPLAY SYSTEM UPDATESA followup to the last patch’s updates on how the “Use Object” button functions (“F” on PC and Square/X on Console by default).To simplify layered debuff states, all persistent attached debuffs will be removed at once by holding the “Use Object” button.For example, Cypher Dart and Deadlock GravNet will both be removed if they happen to be stacked on you at the same time.BUG FIXESGeneralFixed a bug where players could plant the spike outside or float partially above the site's designated area.
