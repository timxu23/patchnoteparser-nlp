Version detection:
- Look for "VALORANT Patch Notes <number>" to extract patch version (e.g., 11.09). Regex: patch notes (\d+\.\d+)

Sections to skip entirely:
- GENERAL UPDATES / GENERAL
- COMPETITIVE UPDATES
- ESPORTS UPDATES
- GAMEPLAY SYSTEMS UPDATES
- BUG FIXES
- CONSOLE ONLY / PC ONLY / platform-only sections

Sections to keep:
- AGENT UPDATES / AGENTS
- Specific agent headings (e.g., RAZE, JETT, Viper, etc.) and their bullets/sub-bullets

Relevance filters for lines:
- Keep bullets/paragraphs that have numbers OR buff/nerf keywords (increase/decrease/reduced/increased/added/removed/adjusted, etc.).
- Ignore pure flavor text without numbers/keywords.

Parsing hints:
- Agent context can come from the current heading or from the text itself.
- Ability names often appear in bold/strong inside bullets.
- Use old/new patterns like "X >>> Y", "X -> Y", "from X to Y" to capture numeric deltas and units (sec, damage, cost, cooldown, etc.).
