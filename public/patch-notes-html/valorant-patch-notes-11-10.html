                The Harbor Rework is finally here! We’ve overhauled Harbor’s abilities to move him into a more aggressive Controller, with a
                <em>
                 splash
                </em>
                of Initiator. High Tide was an iconic part of his kit and we wanted players to be able to carry over their mastery and creativity from High Tide casts in the past. We’ve moved Cove into the signature slot with a few changes to make it easier to place with precision. This should help Harbor find more ways to block vision for his allies from afar or Shield them depending on the situation. Harbor will be gaining a new ability to help with aggressively taking gun fights, Storm Surge! Reckoning also received a massive update, making it easier to set up his allies to flood into enemy territory.

                Clove is dominating competitive queue pick rates and preventing other controllers from being picked. These changes are aimed at shaving off Clove’s snowballing power. When Clove’s team gets ahead in advantageous states, they very easily outperform other controllers.

              Starting in 11.10, all Ascendant+ players in NA, LATAM, BR, and KR, must enable Riot Mobile multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access Competitive queue. Other modes will remain unaffected.
              <ul>
               <li>
                Why Ascendant+? Our highest ranked players are capable of inflicting the greatest harm when smurfing and are at risk of more competitive integrity violations as an outcome to sharing accounts – i.e. win trading.
